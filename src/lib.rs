//! Rust binding for librpm: the RPM Package Manager library
//!
//! This crate contains idiomatic Rust bindings which aim to expose a safe
//! API to librpm. The low-level unsafe bindings are located in the
//! [librpm-sys] crate, which is automatically generated by bindgen.
//!
//! Make sure to call `librpm::read_config` to load rpmrc configuration.
//!
//! See the `librpm::db::Database` type for examples of how to interact with
//! the RPM database.
//!
